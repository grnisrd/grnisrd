üëã Hey there, I'm Louka. There's no way to properly pronounce my username, but I like "green is red".

### What I'm working on
- [**picoedit**](https://github.com/grnisrd/picoedit), a small, portable, and performant general purpose code/text editor with batteries included.
- [durlin](https://github.com/grnisrd/durlin), a statically-typed, domain-specific, procedural, and predictable programming language that defines finite-state machines ([FSMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)).

### What I am
- The COO at [Synapse Softworks LLC](https://github.com/synllc). 
- A member of the [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org/consortium/consort.html).
- I'd prefer to live in an igloo but climate change is making it impossible.

### What I like in tech
- Parser, compilers, tracers. The stuff that programming languages need to work.
- Metaprogramming libraries and utilities, like code generation and preprocessing.
- Web development, both frontend and backend, with awesome frameworks like Nextjs and Svelte.
- Finding creative ways to optimize large programs in both speed, memory and complexity.
- Modernizing painfully _prehistoric_ codebases. Seriously, I've done it so much it's muscle memory.
- The occasional bit of reverse engineering. Mainly Windows apps.

### What I like _outside_ of tech
- The cold. Warming yourself up is better than cooling yourself down.
- Forests. Trees. Flora and fauna. Staying inside all day makes me go crazy.
- Writing. Very domain-specific, shouldn't be of interest to most people.
- Simplicity. I practice simple living and self-sufficiency. Recommended reads:
  - [Voluntary Simplicity](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/305597) by Duane Elgin.
  - The _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius. You can easily find a copy online.
- Chicken soup. üêî
